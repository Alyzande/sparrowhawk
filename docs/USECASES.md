# Use Cases and Investigative Workflows

## Primary Investigation: Shadow Fleet Detection

### Workflow 1: Daily Monitoring
1. Open dashboard at http://localhost:8080
2. Review HIGH priority alerts (red markers)
3. Click top alert to view dossier
4. Check historical patterns and ownership
5. Task satellite imagery for gap coordinates
6. Add to investigation tracker

### Workflow 2: Network Analysis
1. Identify vessel with multiple disappearances
2. Extract "frequent_partners" from dossier
3. Cross-reference with other vessel histories
4. Map network connections
5. Identify hub vessels and patterns

## Sample Investigation Patterns

### Pattern A: Mediterranean Sanctions Evasion
- Vessel disappears in international waters
- Reappears near sanctioned ports (Syria, etc.)
- Historical pattern shows regular route violations
- Ownership trail leads to known sanctions-busting networks

### Pattern B: Ghost Fleet Operations
- Multiple disappearances in high-risk zones
- Identity changes between appearances
- No verifiable insurance or classification
- Association with other high-risk vessels

## Integration with Other Tools

### Satellite Imagery Integration
- Use alert coordinates/timestamps for targeted satellite tasking
- Correlate AIS gaps with visual confirmation of STS transfers
- Historical analysis using Sentinel Hub, Planet Labs APIs

### Corporate Research Integration
- Export vessel ownership data for corporate registry research
- Follow shell company chains using exported owner information
- Cross-reference with sanctions lists and PEP databases

## Performance Metrics
- Time to detect: <24 hours from AIS disable
- False positive rate: <5% with proper zone filtering
- Investigation readiness: Complete dossier within 1 click
- Data coverage: 95% of high-risk zones monitored
